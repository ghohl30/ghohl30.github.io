  <h1>Bludenz Trip</h1>
  
  <p>Last week, I impulsively decided to treat myself with an overnight wellness trip to Austria. The previous weeks had been quite rough, and I had just received another paycheck, so I thought it would be the prefect opportunity to get some fresh air. I did not really build this blog to create another unnecessary travel blog. But since I haven&rsquo;t found the time to post about a more serious topic, this will maybe help me get started.</p>
<p>Additionally, I just wanted to share my enthusiasm about the solo wellness experience. It can feel a bit pathetic to book a wellness trip just for yourself. It feels like something you are supposed to do with your partner, or at least a friend. And while relaxing with your partner is always a great way to get some quality time, going alone is a totally different experience. The quiet surroundings help clear your mind and give you time to think and cooldown in a way that would not be possible with another person at your side.</p>
<p>Rising with the sun, I eagerly set out from Zurich to make the most of my two-day trip. But fate had other plans, as I missed my stop in Bludenz. Determined not to let this setback dampen my spirits, I decided to make the most of my two-hour layover and hit the pavement for a run. As I raced through the beautiful surroundings of St. Anton, I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel grateful for this unexpected detour.</p>

<p>The rest of the trip was very much according to plan. I ended up going for another run and a swim. The rest of the time I either explored the surrounding of my hotel or relaxed in the sauna. I can really recommend the Val Blu resort in Bludenz. It has everything you need and is very affordable. The rooms are kept very basic, but since I don&rsquo;t usually spend a lot of time in my room, I actually prefer not to pay of any extra stuff in that regard. The next day I returned to Zurich, rejuvenated and relaxed.</p>
