      <description>As you can imagine, the emergence of better and better generative AI models has been a source of great excitement in my life recently. I have had access to the OpenAI API for a while now but hadn&amp;rsquo;t used it much. This changed with the introduction of ChatGPT and especially GPT-4, which for me has been a whole new level so far. I have played around with it for different small projects.</description>

      <description>A while back, my girlfriend and I went on a road trip in her father&amp;rsquo;s camper van. As a board game enthusiast, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist bringing along the highly portable game of Hive to try out. Hive is a fascinating abstract game where players aim to surround their opponent&amp;rsquo;s bee with various insects. Although I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the chance to play it extensively, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been curious about the ideal opening strategy and whether the game is truly balanced.</description>

      <description>No-code platforms, such as Bubble.io, have transformed the world of application development, enabling individuals—even those without coding experience—to create solutions to everyday problems with ease. These tools support quick MVP creation and fast iterations for testing new ideas, democratizing innovation. With this in mind, I recently reimplemented my queue management system, q-app.ch, using Bubble.io, and I&amp;rsquo;m eager to share how this no-code platform streamlined the development process and brought q-app to life faster than ever.</description>

My latest project, q-app.ch, is a free, easy-to-use, real-time queue management system that utilizes QR codes to streamline waiting lines at various venues. In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll delve into why I decided to pursue this project, the background of previous implementations, and the technical details that went into building q-app.</description>

      <description>Last week, I impulsively decided to treat myself with an overnight wellness trip to Austria. The previous weeks had been quite rough, and I had just received another paycheck, so I thought it would be the prefect opportunity to get some fresh air. I did not really build this blog to create another unnecessary travel blog. But since I haven&amp;rsquo;t found the time to post about a more serious topic, this will maybe help me get started.</description>

      <description>My fascination for building on the web has been going on for a while. Many years ago I build my first project for the web. It was a wordpress travel blog that required very little technical knowledge and mainly served as way to update my family and friends.
From python to the web After diving deeper and deeper into the python world throughout my studies of physics and machine learning, I started to give the web another go.</description>

      <title>Building a site with hugo</title>

      <description>I thought the best way to get this blog started would be to let you know how it was created. My goal for this website was to have an extended CV that I could share quickly and to have a place on the web to share my experiences. My fist thought was wordpress. While I have no experience using wordpress I know that it is very widely used and I like that it provides a cheap open-source way to the web.</description>
