<p>As you can imagine, the emergence of better and better generative AI models has been a source of great excitement in my life recently. I have had access to the OpenAI API for a while now but hadn&rsquo;t used it much. This changed with the introduction of ChatGPT and especially GPT-4, which for me has been a whole new level so far. I have played around with it for different small projects. My first experiments involved letting different instances (different system messages) of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models discuss amongst one another to solve more complex tasks. This was before Auto-GPT became well-known. Another fun idea was a job interview coach. It&rsquo;s a command-line tool that starts asking you questions and continuously provides you feedback. However, this blog post today is just a short discussion of the amazing creativity that can be unlocked with these generative tools.</p>
<p>The embedded YouTube video was created by me, a person with no artistic abilities (cannot draw) and virtually no editing experience, in about one hour. The entire script was written by GPT-4. All I provided was the idea of the story and some guidance as to what kind of ending I preferred. GPT-4 kept trying to push a happy ending. All the images were created with Bing Image Creator (not as good as Midjourney, but free). Stable diffusion is also a good option, but in my experience, it required a bit more prompt engineering to get good results. The ideas for images came directly from GPT-4, and it also instructed me about what text should be read over which images. The voice is, of course, also artificially generated by Elevenlabs. They have voice cloning options that allow for great customization, but I just used the free tier. Finally, I quickly put everything together in iMovie.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-my-take-on-this">What is my take on this?</h3>
<p>I just want this to be a quick post about the video and do not want to go into too much depth here, but I am simply amazed by the possibilities now open to us. This could lead to great democratization of skills and learning opportunities, as well as making professionals much more productive. If all goes well and the singularity does not consume us, this could lead to a more beautiful world with more art and better stories, and I am excited for that.</p>
