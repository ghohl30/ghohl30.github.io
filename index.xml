      <description>I thought the best way to get this blog started would be to let you know how it was created. My goal for this website was to have an extended CV that I could share quickly and to have a place on the web to share my experiences. My fist thought was wordpress. While I have no experience using wordpress I know that it is very widely used and I like that it provides a cheap open-source way to the web.</description>
